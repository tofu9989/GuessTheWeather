# Weather Guessing App

## Introduction
Welcome to Guess The Weather, a fun and interactive weather guessing app developed for the Nillion Tinybin bounty challenge. This app allows users to guess the temperature for the next day in Tokyo and compare their guess with the actual temperature retrieved from a weather API. Additionally, the app demonstrates a secure data comparison using Nillion's Nada programs.

## Features
- Weather Guessing: Users input their temperature guess for Tokyo, and the app fetches the actual temperature using a weather API.
- Secure Data Comparison: The app securely compares the user's guess with a randomly generated byte value from the HTTPBin API using Nillion's Nada programs.
